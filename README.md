# Getting Started with Create React App

AC: 

*Components*
* A text input, 
* a “create button”, 
* a list of pending items 
* a list of crossed-off items. 

*Functionality*
* In each list items are sorted alphabetically.
* Typing in the text input filters the lists of items below based on substring match
* Clicking the create button adds a pending list item with the text from the input and clears the input
* Clicking a pending item moves it to the crossed off section. 
* Clicking a crossed off item moves it to pending.
* Create an interface for editing additional metadata for each item, add metadata: category, quantity, and price. All three are optional inputs.
* Quantity and price should be displayed in the list with the items
* Pending items should be grouped by category, while crossed off items remain in one list
* Display a subtotal (sum of all prices) in the pending list.
